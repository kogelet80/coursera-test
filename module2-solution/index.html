<h1>As I did this two-hour job</h1>
<div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><p id="p1">Step1</p>
  	<p>The first five hours I worked hard. I tried to apply all the knowledge gained, and everything that I knew before. I edited the code time after time. I tried again and again. But nothing worked.</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><p id="p2">Step2</p>
  	<p>The next five hours were filled with suffering. I felt terrible. The task did not work. I again and again studied the teaching materials. I rewrote the code over and over again. But he still did not work.</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-md-12"><p id="p3">Step3</p>
